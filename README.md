# Bun Bun Bake Shop
Bun Bun Bake Shop is a local cinnamon roll bakery located in Pittsburgh. Bun Bun Bake Shop sells artisanal flavored cinnamon rolls which come in six different flavors including Original, Original (Gluten Free), Walnut, Caramel Pecan, Pumpkin Spice, and Blackberry. Customers can customize each roll with one of the four different glazing types available: none, vanilla-milk, sugar-milk, and double chocolate. Customers also have the option to create a custom box of cinnamon rolls in which the customers can decide which flavors they want, how many rolls, and the type of glazing on each roll. Customers can customize and place their orders on Bun Bun Bake Shop’s easy to use website guided by a step-by-step process. Given the small-scale business, Bun Bun Bake Shop currently delivers only within the Pittsburgh area.  Giving customers the opportunity to completely customize their order, the unique flavor choices, and the same-day delivery option make Bun Bun Bake Shop a local favorite. 


# Website notes
Bun Bun Bake Shop’s website was designed to immediately attract users to try its artisanal cinnamon rolls. The main goals of the website are to allow users to browse through the different flavors and options available and provide an easy way to customize their orders. All products come with a small description, nutritional information, and an ingredient list, which allows the users – especially those who are more health-conscious – to find the flavor of their choice. The users can easily browse through the different flavors by selecting a flavor from the dropdown menu on the Flavor page. They can start customizing their orders from this page or navigate through the Products page and select the flavor. The Add to Cart process uses a pop-up modal, mimicking popular food delivery sites like Doordash. However, in this design, the customization process is a step-by-step process which makes it easy for users to consider their options carefully and then place the order. The pop-up modal is also effective in not stopping the “shopping process” i.e. the user can add one product to their cart and then go back to browsing more products without having to navigate through multiple pages. 


# Website implementation
Currently, the Bun Bun Bake Shop website is implemented using only HTML and CSS. While some interactive components like collapsibles and popups are already implemented, the rest of the website is static. Interactivity to the website will be added with JavaScript in the coming weeks.
